# C2Cards
 
 
The C2Cards project was motivated by the results of the comparison of the five pathway databases currently included in C2CardsHuman ([Stobbe et al, 2011](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/165)) and the ongoing endeavors to consolidate the different networks for the same organism ([Herrgård et al, 2008](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/n10/full/nbt1492.html); [Thiele and Palsson, 2010](http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v6/n1/full/msb201015.html); [Thiele et al, 2011](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/8). Much time and effort has already been put into the currently available pathway databases and we should profit from this to the fullest extent. However, it requires the commitment and the support of a broad community to construct an initial consensus network and to extend it with new knowledge from domain experts, the scientific literature, and as captured by the various pathway databases. C2Cards can play a role in this endeavor by simplifying the identification of consensus and conflicts between pathway databases and lowering the threshold for experts to contribute.
